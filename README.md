#  Semantic Segmentation Using SegNet Architecture (PyTorch)

This project demonstrates a simplified implementation of **semantic segmentation** using a SegNet-style **encoder–decoder convolutional neural network** in **PyTorch**, trained on a **single traffic scene image**. It showcases how pixel-wise classification can be performed using low-level to high-level feature extraction, pooling indices for precise spatial unpooling, and end-to-end learning.

---

## � What It Does

- Implements a **SegNet-style** architecture (Conv → BatchNorm → ReLU → MaxPool + Indices → Decoder with Unpooling)
- Trains from scratch on a **single uploaded image** using **Google Colab**
- Generates a **synthetic binary segmentation mask** by thresholding the grayscale version of the image
- Visualizes both the **original image** and the **predicted segmentation mask**

---

## Features

- Fully runnable in **Google Colab**
- Manual image upload support via `files.upload()`
- Automatic resizing to **256×256**
  
- Segmentation mask output visualization with **matplotlib**
