# Semantic-Segmentation
Developed a semantic segmentation model using SegNet architecture with convolutional layers, Batch Normaliza- tion, ReLU activations, and encoder-decoder design. Incorporated pooling, upsampling, and softmax layers to achieve accurate pixel-wise classification on different images.
